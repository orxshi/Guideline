## Registration period

Check out [Academic calendar](https://portal.gaueng.org/calendar/cal.php) for registration dates. Make sure you register before registration deadline to avoid late registration penalty.

## Identifying your advisor

Visit [Student Portal](https://student.gau.edu.tr/). Login with your student number and password. For the first login, password is your student ID.

{% include warning.html content="Change your password after first login for your security." %}

Click **My Information** tab and **My advisor** tab to know your advisor. If you don't see your advisor's name, then your advisor hasn't been assigned yet. See engineering faculty's secretary for help.

## Find your advisor's office

Go to engineering faculty. If you cannot find it, see [campus map](https://portal.gaueng.org/gaumap/GAUmap.html). Find either your advisor's room directly or see faculty secretary for help.

Your advisor will register and approve your courses. You are advised to keep in touch with your advisor for academic issues, recommendations, and consultation. See you advisor, as soon as possible in case of a problem.
