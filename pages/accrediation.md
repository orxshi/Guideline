Accreditation organizations accredit education programs such as Bachelor of Science (BSc), Master of Science (MSc), and Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD). Accrediation organizations set rules and regulations on education programs. Programs that are accredited by the same organization are equivalent. Accreditation by trusted organizations ensures minimum quality of education and recognition. You are advised to check out whether your program is accrediated.
