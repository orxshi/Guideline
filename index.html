	<h3>Attendance</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Officially, you have to attend 75% of a course, otherwise, you will get NG (Nil Grade).</li>
		<li>Coefficient of NG is 0.00 as F but NG is worse than F
			since you also lose the right to take resit and graduation make-up examinations.</li>

	<h3>How do I check out exam grades?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Visit <a href="https://portal.gaueng.org/index.php">student portal</a> and log in.</li>

		<li>Click Current Grades to know your grades.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>What type of examinations are there?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Midterm and final examinations are regular examinations.</li>
		<li>You can take make-up examination which is replacement of midterm exam as long as you provide medical proof for your excuse of absence.</li>

		<li>There are also graduation make-up exams which can be taken by students about to graduate.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>How successful am I?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>After every semester, your Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is
			calculated based on your letter grades.</li>
		<li>The courses with higher credits will have more weight on your CGPA.</li>
		<li>Your CGPA is calculated out of 4.0. For example, if you get A from all of
			your courses your CGPA will be 4.00 out of 4.00.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>How do I graduate?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Each course has a credit. You will earn the credit by passing a course.

		<li>Once you earn enough credits, you fulfill one the requirements to graduate.</li>
		<li>Visit specific department in <a href="https://portal.gaueng.org/schedule/">departmental schedules</a> to see
			required credits to graduate.</li>
		<li>For example, for <a href="https://portal.gaueng.org/schedule/sched.php?dept=Computer%20Engineering">Computer
				Engineering</a>, you have to earn 132 credits.</li>
		</li>
		<li>Keep your CGPA above 2.0. Students who plan to do Master and PhD degrees are encouraged to have at least 3.0
			CGPA (2.5 for some universities)
			on graduation.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Attending exams</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>You need exam cards to attend midterm/final/make-up/resit exams.</li>
		<li>Get your exam card from faculty secretary.</li>

	</ul>
	<h3>How do I follow announcements?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Visit <a href="https://portal.gaueng.org/index.php">Engineering Portal</a> frequently for announcements such
			as exam
			dates.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>How should I study?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Follow a textbook related to the course along with slides if available.</li>
		<li>If your lecturer follows a textbook, find the PDF of the textbook and follow it.</li>
		<li>If your lecturer does not follow a textbook, find the PDF of the textbook that is related to the course.</li>
		<li>Study daily and avoid procrastination. Starting studying a week before any examination is a very risky strategy.</li>
